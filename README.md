## **üå≥ About The Project**

**Project Soundscape** is a mission-driven initiative to create a live, global sound-map of our planet's health. Using a simple mobile app, anyone can record 15 seconds of audio, which our AI models then analyze to identify everything from a rare bird song to the noise of urban traffic.

Our goal is to empower researchers, conservationists, and communities with the data they need to:

* **Track Biodiversity:** Monitor animal populations and detect endangered species in real-time.  
* **Study Noise Pollution:** Understand the impact of human activity on our environments.  
* **Promote Environmental Awareness:** Connect people with the sounds of the world around them.

We believe that by listening to the world, we can better understand and protect it.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Our Technology Stack**

This project is built with a modern, scalable, and open-source stack. We leverage a microservices architecture to keep our components modular and maintainable.

## **üó∫Ô∏è Project Repositories**

This organization hosts all the official source code for Project Soundscape.

* [**soundscape-app**](https://www.google.com/search?q=pro26.in)**:** The main Flutter application for iOS and Android. This is what our users interact with.  
* [**soundscape-api-server**](https://www.google.com/search?q=pro26.in)**:** The Python and FastAPI server that hosts our AI models (Perch v2 and YAMNet) on Hugging Face Spaces.  
* [**soundscape-backend**](https://www.google.com/search?q=pro26.in)**:** Contains the Appwrite backend functions (Node.js) that act as the bridge between the app and the AI service.  
* [**soundscape-website**](https://www.google.com/search?q=pro26.in)**:** A simple, static website to showcase the project and the live sound-map.
